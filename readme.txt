== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I export Shopify products to WooCommerce? =
If you need to export products from your Shopify store to WooCommerce, check the corresponding box in the Migration Wizard while setting the migration. However, keep in mind that due to the WooCommerce peculiarities, by default, Cart2Cart will migrate product options to WooCommerce as product variants.
We recommend to previously install a paid [Product Add-Ons](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-add-ons) on your WooCommerce store so that your product options could be moved directly into the plugin without being converted to variants.

= Is it possible to preserve the Shopify order IDs while migrating to WooCommerce? =
Yes, with Cart2Cart you can preserve your order IDs when transferring from Shopify to WooCommerce. However, you have to install the free [WooCommerce Sequential Order Number](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-sequential-order-numbers) module prior to the migration. When installed, choose the Preserve order IDs on the Target Store option on the appropriate Migration Wizard step.

= Is multilanguage migration from Shopify to WooCommerce supported? =
Yes, Cart2Cart has all the functionality to transfer multiple languages from Shopify to WooCommerce provided the paid [WPML module](https://wpml.org/purchase/?aid=152220&affiliate_key=dbnIdBw9K0xa) is installed on your WordPress before the migration.

= Can I migrate taxes from my Shopify store to WooCommerce? =
Yes, but after the migration to WooCommerce, the taxes will be already included in the product prices.
